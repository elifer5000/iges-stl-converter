# IGES to STL converter
IGES to STL converter - Final B.Sc. project (2008)

## Description
This program converts IGES files to STL files. The main requirement for the IGES files is that they be saved as “Trimmed Surfaces”. Most CAD exporters have this option in their Export File options. It is recommended that the surfaces be saved as type NURBS.
